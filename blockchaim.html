    <p>1. Blockchain was created in 1991.</p>
    <p>2. Chain of blocks that contain information.</p>
    <p>3. Originally intended to timestamp digital documents so you can’t tamper with them.</p>
    <p>4. Mostly unused until adapted in 2009 to create bitcoin.</p>
    <p>5.Blockchain is a digital ledger completely open to anyone.</p>
      <p>6. Once data becomes recorded inside a blockchain it becomes very difficult to change it.</p>
        <p>7. Each block contains data.</p>
          <p> a. The hash of the block.</p>
            <p> b. The hash of the previous block.</p>
              <p>8. The data stored inside the block depends on the type of blockchain.</p>
                <p>9. The bitcoin blockchain stores details about transactions.</p>
                    <p>  a. Such as sender, receiver and amount of coins.</p>
                    <p>10. A block also has a hash.</p>
                      <p> a. It identifies a block and all of its content.</p>
                        <p> b.Its unique like a fingerprint.</p>
        <p>11. Once a block is created, a hash is being calculated.</p>
        <p>12. When something inside the block is changed, the hash will change.</p>
          <p>13. ashes are very useful when you want to detect changes to the block.</p>
            <p>14. If the hash of the block changes, it's no longer the same block.
  <p>           15.  The third element inside each block is the hash of the previous block</p>
        <p>   a.   This makes a chain of block</p>
          <p>  b.  This is what makes a block chain so secure.</p>
        <p>  16.    The first block is called the genesis block.
        <p>   17.   If you tamper with a block it cause the hash of the block to change, making all the following blocks invalid, because they no longer store a valid hash of the previous block.</p>
        <p>  18.    Using hashes is not enough to prevent tampering because if you can change one block you can effectively change the hashes of the other blocks.</p>
          <p> 19.   To mitigate this you need something called proof of work.</p>
      <p>     a.   A mechanism that slows down the creation of new blocks.</p>
          <p> 20.   In bitcoins case it takes about ten minutes to calculate the required proof of work and create a new block in the chain.</p>
          <p>  21.  It makes it hard to tamper with because if you tamper with one block you’ll need to recalculate the proof of work for all the following blocks.</p>
  <p>        22.    The security of a blockchain comes from the effective use of hashing and the proof of work mechanism.</p>
          <p>  23.   One more way the blockchains secure themselves is by being distributed instead of  using a central entity to manage the chain.</p>
          <p>   24.  Blockchains use a peer to peer network that allows everyone to join.</p>
        <p>  25.    When someone joins the network, they get a full copy of the blockchain. The node can use this to verify that everything is still in order.</p>
        <p>   26.   When someone creates a new block it is sent to everyone in the network, each node then verifies the block to make sure it hasn't been tampered with, if everything works out each node adds this to their own blockchain.</p>
<p> a. All the nodes in this network create consensus they agree on what block are valid or not.</p>
  <p> b. Block that are tampered with will be rejected by other nodes in the network.</p>
